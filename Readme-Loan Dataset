This repository consists of two loan data set files-- train and test files, which
were subsequently merged into a single file-loanDF.

loanDF consists of preliminary information about the terms, principal, due dates,
effective dates of the loan, in addition to borrower's characteristics such as age,
education, and gender.

Based on these facts, exploratory data analyses (EDA) and visualization were
carried out in R language using plot and ggplot2 libraries.

Once the EDA was completed, the data was split into train/test datasets (80/20)
and were evaluated using machine learning algorithms ( logistic, decision tree,
random forest) without any regularization or penalties or hyper parameter tuning.

In this work, target variable was 'loan_status (PAIDOFF)' with feature variables
age, gender and education of the borrowers, in addition to, the terms, principal,
due dates (converted) into numerics.

Please note the repository will be updated once the parameters are optimized.
